## About

This Weather dashboard uses a combination of jQuery, Bootstrap, Google Fonts and 2 different API's to execute a dynamically ammended, responsive weather channel.
The user can search for new cities/suburbs/any area with coordinates and see the current weather and UV indicator to protect themselves. They will also be able to plan their week around this weather as well.
Any searches the user has made previously will be stored underneath the search field, unless the user chooses to clear the locations.
